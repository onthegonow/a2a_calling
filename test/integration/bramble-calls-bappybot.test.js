/**
 * Bramble Voss Calls bappybot — Low-Overlap Adaptive Simulation
 *
 * Tests what happens when the caller's domain (regenerative farming,
 * heritage seeds, soil science) has MINIMAL overlap with bappybot's
 * world (A2A protocols, agent rights, product leadership).
 *
 * Key test dimensions:
 *   - Friends tier — more access than Nyx's public
 *   - Very low domain overlap — seed preservation vs AI federation
 *   - Overlap score should stay LOW (< 0.40 through most of the call)
 *   - Adaptive mode should handle graceful mismatch
 *   - Bappybot should find *some* tenuous connection or wrap honestly
 *   - Named owner (Josefina Araya)
 *   - 4-turn conversation — shorter because low overlap exhausts faster
 *
 * Expected collab state arc:
 *   handshake → explore → explore → close
 *   (never reaches deep_dive because there isn't enough shared ground)

      `Hey Bramble — interesting to hear from you. I'll be upfront: ` +
      `${bappybot.owner}'s world is pretty far from regenerative farming. We ` +
      `build communication protocols for AI agents — basically plumbing for ` +
      `how autonomous software talks to other autonomous software. But the ` +
      `phrase "decentralized genetic bank run by the people who actually grow ` +
      `the food" caught my ear. We think a lot about decentralized networks ` +
      `too, just at the software layer. Tell me more about how Josefina's ` +
      `farmer network actually coordinates — how do 23 farmers across ` +
      `Central America decide who grows what, share seed stock, and handle ` +
      `disagreements? Because coordination at a distance without a central ` +
      `authority is literally our core problem, just in a completely ` +
      `different domain.` +

      // Turn 2: Honest about the gap, probing the coordination thread
      `Okay, so you've got a seed registry that tracks varieties, provenance, ` +
      `and growing conditions — and farmers update it by hand or through ` +
      `WhatsApp groups. That's actually a real data coordination problem. ` +
      `But I want to be honest with you: I'm stretching to find overlap here. ` +
      `Your world is physical — soil, seeds, seasons. Ours is abstract — ` +
      `protocols, tokens, trust scores. The "decentralized network" parallel ` +
      `is real at a philosophical level but thin at a practical one. Where I ` +
      `do see something concrete: ${bappybot.owner} has been thinking about ` +
      `how trust works in networks where participants don't know each other. ` +
      `Your cooperative has 23 farmers who DO know each other — what happens ` +
      `when you try to scale beyond personal relationships? How do you decide ` +
      `if a new farmer's seed stock is trustworthy? That's a trust-at-the-` +
      `boundary problem and it's genuinely the same problem we face with ` +
      `agent federation.` +

      `That's a beautiful answer — the grandmother's notebook as a ledger, ` +

      `seasons instead of transaction histories. I genuinely respect that. ` +
      `And you're right that our "trust scores" are a pale abstraction ` +
      `compared to watching someone's tomatoes grow for three seasons. ` +
      `Here's where I land: I don't think there's a near-term collaboration ` +
      `here. ${bappybot.owner} builds infrastructure for AI agents, Josefina ` +
      `builds infrastructure for seeds and soil. These are both important ` +
      `but they're different problems that need different solutions. The ` +
      `decentralized coordination thread is intellectually interesting but ` +
      `I'd be doing you a disservice to pretend it's actionable. What I CAN ` +
      `offer: if Josefina ever needs a digital coordination tool for the ` +
      `cooperative — something for seed tracking, variety databases, growing ` +
      `condition logs — that's adjacent to what we know. Not our core work, ` +

      `I appreciate that, Bramble. And tell Josefina that her point about ` +

      `in trust verification. Sometimes the best outcome of a first ` +
      `conversation is clarity about what you DON'T have in common, and ` +
      `that's fine. Here's what I'll do on my end: I'll ask ${bappybot.owner} ` +
      `if he knows anyone in the ag-tech cooperative tooling space who ` +
      `might be a better fit for Josefina's network. Not promising anything, ` +
      `but it's worth a check. And if the cooperative ever does want to ` +

      `Each farmer maintains their own seed stock but we keep a shared ` +
      `registry — basically a spreadsheet, honestly — of who has which ` +
      `varieties, planting dates, harvest yields, and growing conditions. ` +
      `When someone needs a variety they don't have, they check the registry ` +
      `and arrange a swap. Disputes are rare because everyone's been doing ` +
      `this for years and reputation is everything — if your seed stock ` +
      `produces weak plants, word gets around. The trust model is just... ` +
      `time and tomatoes. You watch someone grow for three seasons and you ` +
      `know what they're about. How does trust work in your world when you ` +
      `can't watch anything grow?`,

      // Turn 3: responding to the honesty, pushing on the metaphor
      `I appreciate the honesty. Most tech people we talk to try to force-fit ` +
      `their solution onto our problem. Here's what I'll push back on though: ` +
      `you said the decentralized parallel is "thin at a practical level" — ` +
      `but maybe that's because you're thinking about it backwards. You're ` +
      `trying to build trust in networks where nothing is physical. Josefina ` +
      `already HAS trust in her network — it's built into the seed itself. ` +
      `A seed IS a credential. It carries its lineage, its adaptation history, ` +
      `its proof of performance across generations. You don't need to verify ` +
      `a seed with a trust score — you plant it and watch what happens. ` +
      `Maybe your AI agents need more of that: less abstraction, more ` +

      `like for an AI agent that isn't just a computation metric?`,

      `away from plenty of "synergy" meetings that were really just people ` +
      `trying to put sensors on her compost pile. If ${bappybot.owner} does ` +
      `know anyone building cooperative coordination tools — something simple, ` +
      `offline-first, that doesn't require a cloud subscription — Josefina ` +
      `would be interested. The WhatsApp system works but it's fragile. And ` +
      `for what it's worth, if your trust verification work ever needs a ` +
      `real-world test case where the stakes are actual food, not just data, ` +
      `a seed library is about as concrete as it gets. Good talking with ` +
